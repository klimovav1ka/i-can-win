Hello.
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet, to go over
Everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about
who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet
